Vivek Natarajan Bio:

I am an AI researcher in the Health AI team at Google working to accelerate biomedical AIâ€™s translation from code to clinic and scale world-class healthcare to everyone.

My current research spans improving the accuracy, generalization and safety of medical AI using techniques like self-supervised learning, multimodal learning and reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in building large foundation models for biomedical applications.

I work on applications ranging from medical imaging to health records modeling and life sciences.

My research has been published in well-regarded journals and conferences like Nature Medicine, JMLR, CVPR, ICCV and NeurIPS.

Prior to joining Google, I worked on multimodal assistant systems at Facebook AI Research and published award winning research, was granted multiple patents and deployed AI models to products at scale with hundreds of millions of users.

Besides my work at Google, I am part of the South Park Commons community.

I am an active angel investor and have invested in a handful of companies working in AI, health, longevity and climate change. I also serve as an AI and technical advisor to several startups and nonprofits.
